1.How many earthquakes are listed in the table?

 Command: tail -n +2 Y*.tsv | wc -l
 Ans: 5958

2.How many columns are in the table?

 Command: head -1 *.tsv
 Ans: 47

3.Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the
  column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visually count the column numbers for the above fields (there is also
  a unix command to do this, but we didn't cover it in class). Call the new data file
  'Year_Mag_Country.tsv'. You can use 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv' for the rest of the exercises below.

 Command: cut -f 3,10,18 signif.txt.tsv > Year_Mag_Country.tsv

4.EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.

5.Command: sort -g -k 2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | tail -10 
 Ans:1965     8.7    USA
     1716     8.8    PERU
     1812     8.8    USA
     2010     8.8    CHILE
     1700     9.0    USA
     1952     9.0    RUSSIA
     2004     9.1    INDONESIA
     2011     9.1    JAPAN
     1964     9.2    USA
     1960     9.5    CHILE

6.How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this
  question.

 Command: tail -n +2 Y*.tsv|cut -f3 |sort|uniq|wc
 Ans:153

7.Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY

 Command:grep "USA" Y*.tsv | wc
 Ans: 294 

8.Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and
  you may need to call grep more than once.

 Command:grep "USA" Y*.tsv | grep -v "USA TERRITORY"|wc
 Ans:255

9.Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint:
  this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.

  Command:cut -f3 Y*.tsv|sort|uniq -c|sort -g|tail -10
  Ans:193 MEXICO
      207 PHILIPPINES
      255 USA
      259 GREECE
      319 TURKEY
      324 ITALY
      363 INDONESIA
      365 IRAN
      400 JAPAN
      579 CHINA
          
10.Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as
   the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use the special variable $1. Paste your script below and give an
   example calling sequence for country USA.

   Script: #!/bin/bash

           file=Year_Mag_Country.tsv
           y=$1

           answer=$(grep "$y" "$file"|wc -l)

           echo "$y=$answer"

   Example: USA=294
11.Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Use the echo command before each command to create labels for each returned value. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for
   country CHILE.

   Script: #!/bin/bash

           file=Year_Mag_Country.tsv
           y=$1
        
           answer=$(grep "$y" "$file"|wc -l)
           Largest_years=$(grep "$y" "$file"|sort -g -k2|tail -1|cut -f1)
           Largest_magnitude=$(grep "$y" "$file"|sort -g -k2|tail -1|cut -f2)
        
           echo "$y's total earthquake count=$answer;
           $y's largest earthquake magnitude is$Largest_magnitude in $Largest_years."

   Example: CHILE's total earthquake count=192;
            CHILE's largest earthquake magnitude is 9.5 in 1960.

12.Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your
   command and the top ten list below.
   Command:cut -f1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv|sort|uniq -c|sort -g|tail -10
   Ans: 59 2011
        60 2002
        60 2005
        60 2009
        61 2006
        62 2010
        67 2007
        72 2003
        77 2008
        78 2004
